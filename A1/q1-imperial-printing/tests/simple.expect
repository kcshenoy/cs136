You take three barley corns, that gives you an "inch".
You then take 12 in, that gives you a "foot".
You take three ft, and it gives you a "yard".
If you take 1,760 yd, you get a "standard mile".

If you take 12.5% of a mi, you have a "furlong".
These fur you can divide into tenths and you get a "Gunter's Chain".
Each ch, you can split into 11, and you get a "fathom".

If you take 100 ftm, you get a "cable".
You can take ten cb and you get a "nautical mile";
a nmi of course being wildly different from a mi:
while the nmi is 72,960 in, the standard mile is exactly 63,360.

What a fantastically logical and consistent system of units!
